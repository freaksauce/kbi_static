                <h2>SERVICES</h2>
                <h3>Custom Furniture and Upholstery</h3>
                <p>We can create a perfect piece of furniture designed to suit a specific space or shape. Our upholsterer/furniture maker is one of the most skilled makers in Sydney and produces pieces that are second to none in quality and workmanship. All of our custom
                  upholstered pieces are created and made here in Sydney.</p>
                <h3>Custom Designed Cushions</h3>
                <p>We can create and design beautiful cushions to suit your bespoke interior. Whether it is a single cushion or numerous cushions for an entire home, our cushions are hand made here in Sydney and can be made in any fabric with quality feather inserts.</p>
                <h3>Art and accessories selection</h3>
                <p>With many contacts in the art and accessories industries we can find pieces to suit your budget and style. Art and accessories can pull the entire project together so are chosen with every detail in mind.</p>
                <h3>Flooring Selection</h3>
                <p>Flooring is one of the most important elements in a room. It is the basis for both the visual style of the interior and also needs to be one of the most functional and durable elements in the design.</p>
                <h3>Soft Furnishings and Window Treatments</h3>
                <p>We can custom design your curtains, blinds, rugs and more. Many factors are considered in the selection process and our knowledge and passion for beautiful fabrics helps us create window dressings that are visually stunning and durable.</p>
                <h3>Kitchen and bathroom selections</h3>
                <p>Our attention to detail is paramount when selecting hard finishes, tiles, tapware, benchtops, lighting, door hardware, and bathroom and kitchen products. Whilst keeping current trends in mind we are mindful that kitchen and bathrooms add value to a property
                  and aesthetic longevity is important.</p>
                <h3>Lighting selection</h3>
                <p>From pendants to table lamps we can create a lighting design for you. We can custom make shades and have suppliers that are not readily available to the general public.</p>
                <h3>Colour Consultancy</h3>
                <p>With a strong background in colour and design our ability to create beautiful colour palettes and advise on paint choices will result in a fresh and contemporary home or commercial space. With experience consulting on both interior and exterior projects
                  our use of colour is both unique and surprising. We have a flexible attitude towards colour and love both neutral colour schemes or bold saturated colour when desired.</p>
                <h3>Tradespeople and Suppliers</h3>
                <p>Our business couldn't function without the many highly skilled tradespeople that contribute to our work. From wallpaper hanging to installing curtains and blinds, we have a wide range of suppliers and people to call on.</p>
