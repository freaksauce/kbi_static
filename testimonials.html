                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">Kathryn has helped us realise our vision of a 70's inspired Palm Springs design for our new house. Her ideas were creative and true to the brief, whilst also being achievable and within budget. As we have been executing against the design over the past month, Kathryn has continued to be helpfully involved, responding to all our subsequent questions and providing further ideas beyond the original brief. Kathryn took all the stress and doubt out of the process for us, and we are really happy with the outcome.</p>

                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">We loved everything Kathryn recommended for our home. It looks amazing! So timeless and classic; yet warm and inviting. All of our redecorated areas looks so much larger also. Kathryn is so professional, has some wonderful ideas and the products she recommends are all beautiful, it makes it difficult to choose! Her presentations are amazing, she is very efficient and answers any enquiries so promptly. We would highly recommend her! Many thanks again. It feels like we have moved into a new home.</p>

                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">We needed help and advice on the layout and decoration of various rooms and spaces throughout our family home. We found Kathryn Bloomer Interiors service to be invaluable. Kathryn’s vast knowledge of furniture, fabrics and colour, as well as her
                      eye for detail has allowed our home to not only look stunning but contain practical spaces. We were highly impressed with her ideas, commitment to the project and her overall professionalism.</p>

                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">We would like to say thank you so very much for your wonderful service that you provided in styling our home. Your service was second to none, your choice of furniture and accessories enhanced our home for the sale of our property. You created a
                      warm and inviting feel. You were on the ball from the first phone call, and your communication skill was warm and friendly, which made it easy for me. I highly recommend you to any one who is looking for a Stylist or a Interior Decorator to enhance
                      a home. Thank you once again, from very happy clients.</p>

                  <div class="testimonials_item">
                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">We recently undertook a significant renovation on our house, and wanted to turn it from 1970's brown to contemporary Hamptons. We were lucky enough to have Kathryn work on the interiors, which included the kitchen, living room and bedrooms. Kathryn
                      was able to take our ideas and vision and turn them into something really unique. If we didn't get Kathryn on board it probably would have looked bland and a bit like a display home. Instead, we have a home that reflects us as a family, gets lots
                      of compliments from everyone, and more importantly, is not so 'precious' it can handle different groups of people without getting damaged. You came up with ideas that I would never have been able to put together, which I really loved. I never
                      thought I would hire an interior designer, but Kathryn was so easy to work with and professional in her approach. I think one of the most valuable parts of the experience was that Kathryn had access to suppliers and products that I would never
                      had known existed. Plus, there was the fact Kathryn has great taste!</p>

                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">I was in need of some help with inspiration when re-decorating our master bedroom. I enlisted the help of Kathryn at Kathryn Bloomer Interiors. I've been amazed by Kathryn's creativity and her ideas have completely transformed the space. I look
                      forward to working with her again when we transform the rest of the house.</p>

                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">Kathryn from Kathryn Bloomer interiors helped us create the home that we had always dreamed of. After completing the building phase Kathryn helped decorate and furnish our main living areas and dining room. Kathryn made the whole process very simple
                      and stress-free and the result was stunning.</p>

                  <div class="testimonials_item">
                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">I first came across Kathryn’s website when we finally made the decision to sell our unit. I loved the styling she had created in the photographs on her website and thought she would be the right person to style our unit to ensure we could make a
                      good impression and get the best possible price. Kathryn made the entire process from start to finish so easy with her professionalism and warm nature. Throughout the open houses, we received so much feedback about how beautifully the unit was
                      presented. Kathryn was able to style our unit to suit the type of buyer we were aiming to attract. We would absolutely work with Kathryn again in the future.</p>

                  <div class="testimonials_item">
                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">When we decided to sell our house, we knew that our interiors needed an overhaul to help the house look great and get us the best price possible. After doing some research, I found Kathryn’s website and loved her style from client photographs. Dealing
                      with Kathryn was an absolute pleasure during the entire experience, she made everything very easy and liaised with our agents to reduce our workload. We were extremely impressed with how the house looked and our agents were amazed at the transformation
                      given we had our 3 small children living there during the selling period. Ultimately we sold for a price that exceeded our initial hopes and that wouldn’t have happened without Kathryn’s amazing work. We highly recommend Kathryn to anyone selling
                      and wouldn’t hesitate to work with her again in the future.</p>

                  <div class="testimonials_item">
                    <p class="testimonials_item-description">Kathryn Bloomer at Kathryn Bloomer Interiors, was recommended to us by our Estate Agent, Jon Brookes at Brookes Partners at Cronulla. From the moment we met Kathryn, we felt very comfortable and confident with her suggestions and with the decisions
                      we jointly made about the makeover of our home. As we walked throughout our home, Kathryn took photos and made suggestions. The next visit was two days before the photographer was due, to take photos for the Domain, the website and other advertising.
                      Kathryn and the hire company arrived and the makeover began. It was amazing to see what a difference it made. We had hired furniture, chairs, bed linen and other ornaments, lamps and wall hangings. We were thrilled that after just one visit, and
                      photos taken, Kathryn had selected the most amazing things that suited our home perfectly. I would recommend Kathryn Bloomer to others like ourselves, who need some professional advice. Kathryn is a lovely person, who is very easy to work with
                      and does a wonderful job. We were thrilled with the makeover, which helped us to get a wonderful result at the auction.</p>
